auth\-test
Test authentication of a user via the unixd resolver "pam" channel. This does not test that your pam configuration is correct \- only that unixd is correctly processing and validating authentications
.TP
cache\-clear
Erase the content of the unixd resolver cache. You should probably use `invalidate` instead
